# ImpossibleDragon (Paper 1.21.11)

A brutal, multi-phase Ender Dragon fight. Needs Java 21.

## Build
```
mvn clean package
```
Jar ends up in `target/ImpossibleDragon-1.0.0.jar` -> drop into `plugins/`.

## Features
- 800 HP dragon (configurable), damage reduction + per-hit damage cap
- 3 phases (100-66%, 66-33%, <33% ENRAGED with faster cooldowns)
- Explosive dragon fireballs, wither skull barrages
- Telegraphed lightning strikes
- Endermen / vex / phantom minion waves (no loot)
- Tail strike (telegraphed sweep with knockback)
- Lightning breath (charge at the mouth, dodgeable beam)
- Animated purple magic circles + spinning shield around every crystal
- Roar (darkness/nausea/slow) and levitation-drop attack
- Pillar crystals respawn; alive crystals heal the dragon extra
- Dragon lifesteal + damage multiplier
- Bonus XP and item rewards on death

## Commands (`impossibledragon.admin`, alias `/idragon`)
- `/idragon status` - HP, phase, crystals, minions
- `/idragon reload` - reload config and re-apply stats
- `/idragon retune` - re-apply max-health to active dragons

Everything is tweakable in `config.yml`.

## Bedrock (Geyser)
Bedrock players get action-bar warnings + a sound before tail strikes, lightning breath and ground lightning, since Java particles may not render for them. See `effects.warning-text` (`bedrock` | `everyone` | `off`).

## Shield + crystal timers (HEAL_LOCK mode, default)
- The dragon can ALWAYS be hit. The crystals are its healing network: while any crystal lives, it heals.
- Every destroyed crystal has its own 60s respawn timer (floating text that turns yellow/red + a ring that
  fills up). An action-bar "shield race" shows how many crystals are left and when the FIRST one returns.
- Destroy the LAST crystal before the FIRST one respawns -> the shield breaks and the dragon cannot heal at
  all (no crystal healing, no lifesteal) for `shield.broken-seconds` (0 = until the next phase).
- Otherwise crystals just come back one by one. Phase changes and the rebirth bring every crystal back.
- `shield.mode: IMMUNITY` restores the old "immune until the shield breaks, then a short vulnerable window" fight.

## Lightning breath
- Damage goes through the normal dragon damage multiplier, but one hit can never take more than
  `max-health-fraction` (45%) of the player's max HP, so it no longer one-shots. Beam core = full damage,
  rim = `edge-damage-factor`. A red lane shows exactly where the beam will go during the wind-up.

## Rebirth (final form)
The first time the dragon would die, it refuses: it becomes invulnerable for a few seconds while
its health refills to 50%, every crystal returns and the shield comes back. It then fights in
PHASE 4 (FINAL FORM) with faster attacks and +25% damage. The second death is real.

## Three heads
The vanilla dragon keeps its own middle head. The Java pack adds two more heads that are 1:1 copies of the vanilla
dragon head (same boxes, same UVs, same texture incl. glowing eyes, hinged jaw) on necks built from the vanilla neck
segment. The plugin glues them to the dragon (`models.three-heads`, tweak `y-offset` / `scale` in config.yml), so they
bank/tilt with it, sway on their necks and open/close their jaws. Java only: Bedrock/Geyser players still see the
one-headed dragon (the extra heads are ItemDisplays and need the Java resource pack).

## Resource packs (current)
- **Java: `ImpossibleDragon-Java-BetterDragon-Minions.zip`** = the *Better Enderdragon* pack (vanilla dragon mesh, new texture; works on plain 1.21.11, no mods) + dragonling minions, dragon-head wither skulls and the crystal energy sphere + rune circle. Minion/skull models use tiles sampled from the dragon texture so everything matches.
  The dragon itself is NOT drawn by the plugin (`models.dragon.enabled: false`).
- **Bedrock: `ImpossibleDragon-Bedrock-BetterDragon.mcpack`** (Geyser `packs/` folder) = the same dragon texture on the Bedrock dragon, plus dragonling / dragon-head skull / crystal sphere geometry. If dragonlings or skulls face backwards use the `-FLIPPED` file instead (only one).
- Minions are ENDERMITES (buffed 40 HP / 6 dmg); the pack makes every endermite invisible and the plugin draws a flapping dragonling on top. Other minion types keep their vanilla look.
- Rebuild everything with `DRAGON_TEX=<path to dragon.png> python3 tools/build_packs.py out src/main/resources`.
